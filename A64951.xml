         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Browniſts</hi> are acknowledged to be the <hi>Caterpillars</hi> of Religion, who doe daily ſtrive to contaminate the ſincere purity thereof; for they will not be exhorted by <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Propheticall Inſtitution</hi> of the ſacred word of God, but according to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their owne roving fancies they ordaine no Orthodox, but Hereticall opinions, and (that I may uſe their own words) as the ſpirit of Error<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There have bin a ſix reptitious Lecture continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in St Georges pariſh in Southwark, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of about three weeks, and laſt Friday (being the appointed day for the aforementioned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one <hi>Vincent</hi> preached there at the ſame pariſh, but his Doctrine was ſo Schiſmaticall, that there was a great mutiny among the confluxe of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:37997:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 100 -->vulgar. Yet notwithſtanding by the peculiar, &amp; particular ſuggeſtions of ſome of the ſaid pariſh, being of his owne tribe, hee was appointed to preach on the Sabbath day immediatly ſucceeding without the generall aſſent, on conſent of all the Pariſhioners, and being ſuppoſed by his externall geſture to be ſome Scholler, he had more admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then otherwiſe ſhuld have bin granted him. And being confident of his reſolute inſolencie, he nominated his text, and proceeded according to the Tenour of theſe words following.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>HIs text was taken out of the 30: Chapter of</hi> Eſaiah, <hi>and the laſt verſe.</hi> For the fire of Hell is ordained from the beginning, yea even for the King is it prepared, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>Which words he ſaid like the foure rivers, that were divided into foure heads to water the garden. So his Text was divided into three parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Damnation ordained.</item>
                  <item>2. The time when, from the beginning.</item>
                  <item>3. The diſreſpect of perſons, yea for the King it is prepared.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And thus he began with his firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> the Damnation ordained: that all thoſe who would not preach as Coblers, and Tinkers, were damned. Secondly, that thoſe who heard the booke of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> (being in their imaginary ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Popiſh) were damned. Thirdly, that thoſe, who would admit of Biſhops, and ſuch Romiſh
<pb facs="tcp:37997:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 100 -->prieſts were damned. Fourthly, that thoſe who preached or prayed otherwiſe, then the ſpirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, did offend God, &amp; thoſe that offend God ſhould be damned, therefore by conſequence, hee that did not pray <hi>extempore,</hi> or preach according as the ſpirit ſhall inable him, ſhall without doubt be damned.</p>
               <p>And with that he cryed, fire, fire, ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, that I wonder ſome did not ſpit on his face to quench and extinquiſh the flaming fire of his luſtfull mind, and concupiſcence. Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his ſecond particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the time when from the beginning: and then he affirmed poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that all men were from the beginning pre-deſtinated to be damned. But this we know (as his other) is a maine point of blaſphemy. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that no learning, either morall, or divine, was requiſite for the Miniſteriall function, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as the ſpirit moved them.</p>
               <p>And withall he gave his aſſertion, and direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation to heare rather a Cobler, Felt-maker, Tinker, Horſerubber, as thoſe reverend fathers, Mr <hi>Greene,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> &amp;c. then any other Scholler, who ſhall premeditate his Sermon.</p>
               <p>Thus he proceeded in his erroneous opinions, and hereticall doctrine, ſcolding, and rayling at all men, and all profeſſions, that he could recall into his memory, ſtill crying with a deplorable excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, fire, fire, but to what effect I know not, unleſſe he himſelfe did feare Hell-ſire for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, and ſcandalous words.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37997:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->
               <p>But to omit many of his ridiculous proofes, he at length came to his third point of doctrine, <hi>viz</hi> The diſreſpect of perſons, it is appointed for the King himſelfe: but if I ſhould deſcribe in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant declaration each particular Schiſme, that he obſtinatly produced in this regard, I ſhould be more blamed for expreſſing it, then hee was for ſpeaking it: yea, I ſhould be more aſhamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that, which he was not aſhamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>Therefore (judicious Reader) I omit the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his facinorous inference to your better mentall reſervation: neither will I rub the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> of this wound, leaſt it ſhould bleed afreſh. Wherefore when the alarme of his obſtreperous tongue was ended in this <hi>prior diviſion,</hi> he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto ſome other particulars, which were not leſſe dangerous, and hereticall in explication, then the former.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt he affirmed that all Biſhops were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word of God, and therefore <hi>Diabolicall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, that the booke of <hi>Common-Service</hi> was diducted out of the <hi>Popiſh Liturgy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be admitted, or have any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate allowance in our publick Aſſemblies, and Congregations.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, that every one might exerciſe the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, according as the ſpirit ſhall enable them: for firſt, whatſoever comes from the ſpirit is truth. Secondly, the ſpirit cannot ſuggeſt a man amiſſe. Thirdly, that the ſpirit guides a mans thoughts to
<pb facs="tcp:37997:5"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->the right object of heavenly things. Fourthly, that he which is led by the ſpirit, is an abſolute child of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore he did aſſure them to embrace all thoſe good Admonitions, which hee had declared unto them; for he would warrant them that they did all proceed from the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Alſo, divers other things he did peremptorie affirme in his Pulpit, all which would be too long for me to relate. Therefore leaſt I ſhould treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe too far on your element patience, J will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate all in a word, and conclude; While my daily prayers ſhall be, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would take theſe premiſes into their grave conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</p>

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 102 -->as the ſpirit moved him. And after Sermon there was a great hurrying over the pewes, and many came to defend him, and flinging a gray Coat over his ſhoulders, they covered his knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
